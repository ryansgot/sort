sort_android

Abstract:
It can be difficult for any beginning programmer to understand what a sorting algorithm does. This makes it difficult to understand why a one sorting algorithm is better than another. If you throw formulae and proofs at the student, the tendency is to shut down one's mind and accept that smarter people have figured all this stuff already--so there is no point in engaging when memorization works just as well. The author believes that good programmers actually understand the algorithms they use--not simply memorize. Thus, students need a visual representation of the algorithms as they work on a set to provide an intuition that will guide the more rigorous understanding.

Purpose:
sort_android is an open source project intended to educate beginning programmers regarding sorting algorithms by allowing them to repeatedly experiment and interact with the algorithms, comparing the performance of different algorithms side-by-side.
